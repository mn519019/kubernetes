# Why Not NodePort 32228?
The port 32228 is the NodePort assigned by Kubernetes for the nginx-alb service. However, when using an ALB, the traffic is routed through the ALBâ€™s external IP on the standard HTTP port 80, which then forwards the traffic to the appropriate target group and port within your cluster.
